## Basic Introduction

Split data into training (70%) and test (30%). Use set.seed() to make things reproducible.
```{r}

set.seed(100)

split <- initial_split(diabetes, prop = 0.7)
train <- training(split)
test <- testing(split)

```

The goal is to create models for predicting Diabetes_binary (ok to use caret package). Use logLoss as metric to evaluate. For all model types use logLoss with 5 fold CV to select best model. Set up your own grid of tuning parameters in any model where possible.

## Random Forest
